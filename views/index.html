                <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</p></li>
                    <li><p>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <br>
                           to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</p></li>
                    <li><p>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>
                           Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>
                           them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</p></li>
                    <li><p>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</p></li>
                    <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>
                        cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>
                        Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                    <li><p>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>
                           rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>
                           to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</p></li>
                    <li><p>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</p></li>
                    <li><p>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>
                           pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>
                           Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br>
                           resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</p></li>
                    <li><p>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>
                           yields</p></li>
                    <li><p>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>
                           American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br>
                           provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</p></li>
                    <li><p>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>
                            subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br>
                            expanding population</p></li>
                    <li><p>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</p></li>
                    <li><p>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>
                           sorghum yields</p></li>
                    <li><p>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</p></li>
                    <li><p>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br>
                           that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as <br>
                           we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br>
                           because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long <br>
                           before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</p></li>
                    <li><p>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</p></li>
